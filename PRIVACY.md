# AI Visibility Tracker Privacy Notice

Published by Khadin Akbar. Updated 2026-10-03.

AI Visibility Tracker is a skills-only plugin maintained by Khadin Akbar. It guides an AI assistant to use the independently installed official Apify CLI with the user's Apify account. It includes no publisher-operated server, database, analytics or automatic telemetry.

## Requested checks

When you authorize research, the CLI sends the configured domains, page URLs, keywords, questions, competitor domains and run settings to the mapped Apify Actors for AI citations, competitor traffic and rankings, keywords, Google Trends, backlink samples and link discovery. Public result pages may also be inspected to qualify opportunities. Apify executes the run using the Actor's configured services. Answers, citations, diagnostics and run records are returned through Apify. AI, search, traffic, keyword and backlink data providers used by the selected Actors may process the submitted search terms or domains. Use public business information only; do not supply personal, confidential or customer data.

## Credentials

Authenticate with Apify using its official login flow in your own terminal. The plugin does not request tokens in chat, copy authentication files or publish credentials. Apify CLI manages authentication independently. Your assistant and host platform have their own access controls and policies.

## Storage and retention

Apify stores run inputs, results and records in your account according to its own services and policies. The plugin does not promise a fixed retention period or deletion on Apify's behalf. Local exports remain wherever you and your assistant save them. Your host platform may retain conversation content under its own policies. Manage deletion and retention through each service and remove local exports when they are no longer needed.

The skills package itself adds no publisher storage or tracking. The Apify Actor and any separately hosted service are outside this package; their policies also apply. See [Apify privacy information](https://apify.com/privacy-policy) and your AI host's privacy notice.

## Support

Support issues may be publicly visible. Do not attach credentials, private run data or personal information. Use the [support page](SUPPORT.md) to report a redacted problem. Questions about this notice may also be raised through that support channel.

This notice applies to the skills package. It does not replace the privacy terms of Apify, the Actor runtime, AI providers or your AI assistant host.

## User-owned credentials

Every live user must supply their own Apify API token through the official local `apify login` flow or their host's supported secret storage. Authenticate only to that user's account. Never use, bundle, borrow or distribute the publisher's token or authenticated session. If an existing session's ownership is uncertain, have the user verify it locally before billable work. A valid existing user-owned login satisfies this requirement; do not ask the user to paste tokens into chat. Saved-export analysis needs no token.
